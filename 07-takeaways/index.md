# Class Takeaways

As I said in this GitHub, I am honest. And this was honestly one of the worst homeworks I've ever had since highschool mathematics homeworks.

If there is a thing I resent more than brackets in equations, it is brackets in code. But hey, I've managed and there's only one thing to be said. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F2s8ivKXNY&ab_channel=OliverTree"><font color="FF0000"><b>THIS</b></font></a>

Jokes aside, these are my five takeaways from english for designers lessons:
1. Refreshed my presentation skills
2. Got to talk to someone ho is native speaker (kinda missed this)
3. Discover new personal website possibilities via GitHub
4. Found out about advanced Figma animations 
5. Revived my HTML knowledge that hasn't been in use for the last 5 years
