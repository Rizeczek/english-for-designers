### Obstacles

Since beginning I have been consulting possibilites with developers to prevent errors.

One obstacle occured - development limitation.

Because of easier responsive coding, a narrow layout grid had been chosen.

That limited designing space - First idea was to have big fillable table That was impossible to nest into the layout, so we have chosen to design tab group for each category with text fields spaced vertically.

## Summary

The Insurance Calculator was one of my most amusing projects as I had to create the user journey, wireframes and whole design. 

During this project I finally realized, that the UX design is the field I want to educate myself in.

However, this had never been realised because the client havenâ€™t find sufficient amount of funds to finance this project.
