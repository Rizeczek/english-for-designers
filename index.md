<FONT COLOR="#FFE4C2">My name is Petr and I am Prague based UX/UI designer. However, that is not how I began my journey.
<br>
<br>
I started as a junior graphic designer in a marketing agency TRITON IT, where I put hand on creating brand identities, business cards, flyers, brochures and billboards. But what I found most amusing were websites. And that is how i got into <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_u%C5%BEivatelsk%C3%A9ho_rozhran%C3%AD"><font color="FF950A"><b>User Interface Design</b></font></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience"><font color="FF950A"><b>User Experience.</b></font></a>
<br>
<br>
Now I work for the biggest and most profitable Czech telecommunications provider O2 and the rest is history (described in this portfolio).</FONT>
