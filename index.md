My name is Petr and I am Prague based UX/UI designer. However, that is not how I begane my journey.
  
I started as a junior graphic designer in a marketing agency TRITON IT, where I put hand on creating brand identities, business cards, flyers, brochures and billboards. But what I found most amusing were websites. And that is how i got into <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_u%C5%BEivatelsk%C3%A9ho_rozhran%C3%AD">User Interface Design</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">User Experience.</a>
  
Now I work for the biggest and most profitable Czech telecommunications provider O2 and the rest is history (described in this portfolio).
