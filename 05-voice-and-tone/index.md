# Voice and Tone

## Voice

People tend to think of me as a witty person, who takes things with a humour. That is how I approach my clients as well - the conversations are alaways wittyful, light, non-serious. However, it doesn't mean they are not professional, fact-based and topic related. And I listen to my clients.

Thus, my voice would be:

1. Casual with a bit of humour

2. Truthful and honest

3. Sounding open to comments.


## Tone

My tone changes during projects based on the relationship with my client. With my friends, I don't hesitate to use strong language to tell them, that certain idea isn't the best. In professional-to-professional type of client, I am more diplomatic when pointing out bad direction of design or even marketing strategy.

Thus, my tone is:

1. Strong & Diplomatic

Point out bad decisions and navigate the client to opt better with facts and experience.


## Style

My style is free, yet having boundaries. I aim to be consistent in my designs and approaches to clients.
