# Fist Impression
That is not a typo. My designs are going to punch you like a fist.

## About me
My name is Petr and I am Prague based UX/UI designer. However, that is not how I began my journey.

I started as a junior graphic designer in a marketing agency TRITON IT, where I put hand on creating brand identities, business cards, flyers, brochures and billboards. But what I found most amusing were websites. And that is how i got into User Interface Design and User Experience.

Now I work for the biggest and most profitable Czech telecommunications provider O2 and the rest is history (described in this portfolio). My role is to expand MojeO2 (O2 selfcare platform) design system, create in-app ad banners for products and services and draw wireframes for new product deliveries.

The aim of wireframes is to think through individual sections of the website. 

Down here you can see how I draw these sections.

**Obstacles**

Since beginning I have been consulting possibilites with developers to prevent errors.

One obstacle occured - development limitation.

Because of easier responsive coding, a narrow layout grid had been chosen.

That limited designing space - First idea was to have big fillable table That was impossible to nest into the layout, so we have chosen to design tab group for each category with text fields spaced vertically.

**Summary**

The Insurance Calculator was one of my most amusing projects as I had to create the user journey, wireframes and whole design. 

During this project I finally realized, that the UX design is the field I want to educate myself in.

However, this had never been realised because the client havenâ€™t find sufficient amount of funds to finance this project.
